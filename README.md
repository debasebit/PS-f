##### This project is no longer actively developed - Archival purposes only

This project was to create a profile based frontend for the ePSXe and PCSX2 console emulators (PlayStation and PlayStation 2 respectively). As this manifested from a University project from 2008, I have no interest in developing it further.

Originally created in Visual Studio 2008 then 2010, the project can still be built in VS 2015 (as of typing).

Works on any version of Windows with .NET Framework 3.5 installed.

Screenshots coming soon...
